Given the richness of observational data and usefulness of experimental data, researchers hope to develop credible method to combine the strength of the two. In this paper, we consider a setting where the observational data contain the outcome of interest as well as a surrogate outcome while the experimental data contain only the surrogate outcome. We propose a simple estimator to estimate the average treatment effect of interest using both the observational data and the experimental data.
