### Course description

This course will treat Bayesian statistics at a relatively advanced level. Assuming familiarity with standard probability and multivariate distribution theory, we will provide a discussion of the mathematical and theoretical foundation for Bayesian inferential procedures. In particular, we will examine the construction of priors and the asymptotic properties of likelihoods and posterior distributions. The discussion will include but will not be limited to the case of finite dimensional parameter space. There will also be some discussions on the computational algorithms useful for Bayesian inference.
