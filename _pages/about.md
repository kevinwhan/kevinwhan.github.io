About me
------
Hi! I am currently a research scientist at Meta working on LLM for ranking systems. I graduated from Stanford with a PhD in statistics. During my time at Stanford, I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Guido Imbens](https://gsb-faculty.stanford.edu/guido-w-imbens/) and Professor [Johan Ugander](http://web.stanford.edu/~jugander/). My research interests lie in causal inference, especially causal inference with interference and online experimentation (A/B testing). Before coming to Stanford, I completed my undergraduate studies at University of Michigan in 2018 where I obtained B.S. degrees in (Honors) mathematics and (Honors) statistics, with a minor in computer science.

My [dissertation](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/14783556) addresses testing, estimation and inference problems for causal inference with interference. Individual chapters can be found in the publications page.
