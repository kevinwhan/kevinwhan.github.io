About me
------
I am currently a fifth-year PhD student in Statistics at Stanford University. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Guido Imbens](https://gsb-faculty.stanford.edu/guido-w-imbens/) and Professor [Johan Ugander](http://web.stanford.edu/~jugander/). My research interests lie in causal inference and machine learning, especially causal inference with interference and online experimentation. Recently, I am also fascinated by the breakthroughs in large language models (LLM). Before coming to Stanford, I completed my undergraduate studies at University of Michigan in 2018 where I obtained B.S. degrees in (Honors) mathematics and (Honors) statistics, with a minor in computer science.  I did internships at Microsoft in 2018 and Meta/Facebook in 2021 and 2022.

My [dissertation thesis](http://kevinwhan.github.io/files/Kevin_Han_Thesis.pdf) addresses testing, estimation and inference problems for causal inference with interference. Individual chapters can be found in publications page.
