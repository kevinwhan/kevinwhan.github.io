About me
------
I am currently a fifth-year PhD student in Statistics at Stanford University. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Guido Imbens and Professor Johan Ugander. My research interests lie in causal inference and machine learning, especially causal inference with interference and online experimentation. I am also fascinated by the recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLM). Before coming to Stanford, I completed my undergraduate studies at University of Michigan in 2018 where I obtained B.S. degrees in (Honors) mathematics and (Honors) statistics, with a minor in computer science.  I did internships at Microsoft in 2018 and Meta/Facebook in 2021 and 2022.
